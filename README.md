## ðŸ”¹ Practicals Included

1. **Introduction to Arduino Uno**  
   - Basic overview of the Arduino Uno board, pin configuration, and IDE setup.  

2. **Blink the Built-in LED**  
   - A simple program to blink the onboard LED connected to pin 13.  

3. **Blink an External LED**  
   - Connecting an external LED to Arduino and controlling it using digital pins.  

4. **Object Detection using IR Sensor**  
   - Interface an IR sensor with Arduino to detect the presence of an object.  

5. **Distance Measurement using Ultrasonic Sensor**  
   - Measure the distance of an object using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and display results on the Serial Monitor.  

6. **Operating a Servo Motor**  
   - Control the angle of a servo motor based on Arduino signals.
